## A Note About the Email Addresses

If you try to click on any of the Support links in this repository, you'll get a 404 page. Don't despair! You can always reach us at support@climatecoach.com.

So how come the links don't work in this repository? The short answer is: we made a technical tradeoff. The long answer is, we copy the policies in this repository to our product marketing sites.
