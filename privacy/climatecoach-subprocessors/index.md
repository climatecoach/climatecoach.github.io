# Climate Coach subprocessors

*Last updated: July 15, 2023*

We use third party subprocessors, such as cloud computing providers and customer support software, to run Climate Coach (the service). We establish GDPR-compliant data processing agreements with each subprocessor, extending [GDPR safeguards](../index.md) everywhere personal data is processed.

The following is a list of personal data subprocessors we use.

* [Brevo](https://www.brevo.com/gdpr/). Email services provider.
* [FormSpark](https://formspark.io/legal/gdpr/). Form service provider.
* [Google Analytics](https://policies.google.com/privacy). Cloud services provider.
