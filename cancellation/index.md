# Cancellation policy

*Last updated: July 15, 2023*

We want satisfied customers, not hostages. That’s why we make it easy for you to cancel your account directly.

Just email us on cancel@climatecoach.com and we will cancel your account.

Our legal responsibility is to account owners, which means we cannot cancel an account at the request of anyone else. If for whatever reason you no longer know who the account owner is, [contact us](support@climatecoach.com). We will gladly reach out to any current account owners at the email addresses we have on file.

## What happens when you cancel an account?

You won’t be able to access your account once you cancel.

We’ll permanently delete the content in your account from our servers 30 days after cancellation, and from our backups within 60 days. Retrieving content for a single account from a backup isn’t possible, so if you change your mind you’ll need to do it within the first 30 days after cancellation. **Content can’t be recovered once it has been permanently deleted.**

##  Climate Coach initiated cancellations

We may cancel accounts if they have been inactive for an extended period.

We also retain the right to suspend or terminate accounts for any reason at any time, as outlined in our [Terms of Service](../terms/index.md). In practice, this generally means we will cancel your account without notice if we have evidence that you are using our products to engage in [abusive behavior](../abuse/index.md).
